\begin{sloppypar}
	The LMS Project short for the Library management project is a Program written in \verb+python 3.10.7+ language that has a extensive catalog of books that is further extendable to a larger library of books. The Program allows the user to browse the books, by Author, Title, year and ISBN number.

This program is written on \verb+python 3.10.7+ version of python and uses custom and built-in libraries from the python. The connection through the MySQL database is possible through the \verb+MySQL-connector-python+ or \verb+MySQL-connector+ modules downloaded through command line.

This Project is a combined effect of me and my project partner. We collectively worked and tested the program for bugs and problems, to fix them for the end user. Our collective efforts have made a program that is able work as it claims to be. Further we thank our Teacher for guiding and correcting us. The software we used to make this Project possible, had a great contribution either for making PDF or graphics for the document. Python development took place over the Jet Brains PyCharm 2022.2.3 that itself is a sufficient IDLE for its task. Further I want to thank my colleague and others to review this code for any bugs and errors.And Further using the powerful MySQL database system and its software MySQL workbench to complete the query task.

Overall this was a interesting and comprehensive task to make such a project and we are grateful to get such a opportunity.

\part{System and Feasibility}
\section{System and Factors of Feasibility}
\subsection{System Analysis}
Library Management Software is a software that helps a library to catalog and list the books in their library. This Project is based on such a problem to solve some problems regarding --
\begin{itemize}
\item Listing the books 
\item Adding the books
\item Searching the books
\end{itemize}
The extensive catalog of books around the world requires a powerful and efficient database system that is maintained and updated regularly by the developers, one such system is MySQL that is fast and powerful. With Integration with python to make the most out of it, this Project is focused in the connectivity of the two, both python and SQL becomes ideal for a large database like from a library to work fast and responsive. The SQL can handle both very large to extremely large data in a relational form(Tabular form). 

A typical Library Management System comprises of
\begin{itemize}
\item Cataloging
\item Retrieval
\item Adding
\end{itemize}
as one of the core functionality. This program is based on cataloging the data of a library, making the librarian and the users of the library aware of the books inside of the library such that it can be further used for different purposes. 

\section{Terminology}
\subsection{ISBN}
ISBN stands for the International Standard Book Number is a commercial book identifier intended to be unique\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN}. It can be seen in a 10 digit version in old publication and 13 digit in new publication. The ISBN is issued to all the major commercial publication almost all the books have a ISBN. In a book the ISBN looks like a bar-code.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{barcodeisbn.eps}
\caption{ISBN number in a barcode}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Cataloging}
library catalog is a register of all bibliographic items found in a library or group of libraries, such as a network of libraries at several locations\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library\_catalog}. The conventional way of cataloging the books are using the card system. Card Catalog is the a method used for generations, most of the library maintains the card catalog that contains the bibliography of the books. \emph{This program is also made to used as a cataloging program}.

\subsection{Configuration file}
This is a special file that stores the configuration information of the user, like storing details like the user's password, database, user name etc. This file is the file that is used to make the connection to the program that can be edited safely but only changing the field values not the field itself. Here in this program the configuration file which stores the data for the users connection to the MySQL is stored in a special format of file famous for configuration.

\subsection{Feasibility Study}
Feasibility of the program can be divided into 
\begin{description}
\item[Social] The Library Management project is developed taking care of the usability. Its main objective of this Program is being a usable utility to the Librarians in the world. This program allows the user around the world to maintain their own catalog of book in this system for free. The end user can upgrade and modify the source code according to their requirements and can use it and redistribute it to more audience.
\item[Technical] Technically the Program is based on a command line interface and is lightweight. Thanks to python this program is OS independent, that makes the this program to work on any operating system. With some packages and MySQL installed this program must not cause problems while execution. Technically this program can run on a very low spec machine and can be used only when all the dependencies are installed. The minimum requirements of this program is 2 GB memory, 10 GB storage(persistent) and a operating system of choice with Python and MySQL installed init. 

Technically this program is based on cataloging software so display resolution is a matter, a high definition monitor is required for this program to appear intact, because some of the text can be wrapped to another line that can cause the program not so appealing.

\item[Financial] This program is based on Open Source Code and is free to use.

\end{description} 

\section{Usability Analysis and features}
The usability of the program can be described in the following points
\begin{itemize}
\item The use of library management system is crucial as it allows the librarian to display and manage the contents of library. Other person who want access to this system can access it by registering it from the website.
\item The program is made solid out of python and MySQL. Both of the programs are powerful and secure. MySQL being a very popular database management application is used with the very readable python language.

\item Using the \verb+Pypi+ aka \verb+pip+ Library for modules like \verb+PyYAML+ and other builtins. Python allows the user to configure the MySQL using the configuration file that is a \verb+.yaml+ file which is a popular configuration file. Further modules like \verb+os+, \verb+json+, \verb+secrets+, \verb+string+, \verb+time+, \verb+random+ and \verb+yaml+ from the \verb+PyYAML+ package from the Pypi 
\item In a Library, management plays a crucial role because of the simplicity of the LMS program it allows the user to maintain a clean record that is easily maintained.

\subsection{main.py}	

The main file is the integration of all the libraries and is the file that will be executed when running the program \par
\lstinputlisting{main.py}
\newpage
\subsection{SQL utility}

This file is used for the utilities in the SQL database and stores a majority of functions\par
\lstinputlisting{sql_util.py}

\end{figure}

The Package \verb+lms+ is a custom made package that contains the files for the main execution of the program.

The \verb+lms+ package contains files --
\begin{enumerate}\item \verb+sql_util.py+ \item \verb+menu.py+ \end{enumerate}
Both these file contribute to the main file to the core of it. The \verb+menu.py+ is the file that contains all the menu, options and help in it. These are crucial for the working of the program. The user can access using the suitable commands supplied by this file.

The \verb+sql_util.py+ is a very important file because it contains most of the functions that are required by the \verb+main.py+ to work. Further the user's most of the functionality are done by the functions of this file, combining the power of other modules it does the suitable operation for the user such that the user get the desired feedback.

\section{Data Flow of the Program}
Data flow diagram for the program is --
\begin{itemize}
\item Program execution takes multiple steps to reach the final of the program and data is traveled from the python to MySQL as a query or MySQL to python as a result. Further the data execution takes place from the main menu where the user types a certain output to execute a particular function or a query in MySQL to fetch data.

\item Program first asks the data for the credentials to put forward the main menu i.e. to login to the program. The user has to enter his credentials to get access to the MySQL database and use the commands in the main menu. Other wise if the credentials are wrong the user has is thrown out of the program after 3 wrong attempt to verify his credentials. Further more the person has to contact the administrator of the MySQL database who manages the users data is to contacted to register to the program user base, this is done to ensure to keep out any unwanted users from using the database.

\item After a successful login attempt the user is prompted with the main menu of the program. Further he or she can access the data or add data to the tables of MySQL, and can display using the \verb+explore+ command in the program.

\item The user has multiple options to choose like search will retrieve the data from the MySQL and display it to the user, add will add the data to the books database here.

The details regarding the database and its structure is given as follows
\item This project comprises of multiple data flow model used in System Development Life Cycle. The Project uses a hybrid data flow model that comprises of the 
\begin{itemize}
\item Waterfall
\item Circular
\end{itemize}
\item The Circular model is used in the beginning of the program and is generally used for a login screen where a user is looped through a cycle of operations when satisfied in this program enters to the waterfall model where the user is popped with the menu and options to choose from. The options and menu that can be selected by typing it into the command line.

\end{figure}
\newpage

\subsection{SQL Database Structure}
The SQL tables are arranges in the following way such that the tables are accessed using the same database.

There are 2 tables in work with the program.
\begin{itemize}
\item lms\_users
\item books
\end{itemize} 

Both these tables have their own requirements in the program and further in future many others might be added to the database for multiple functionality.

The \verb+lms_user+ table is the table that stores the user's database information the basic description of the table is as follows
\begin{verbatim}
mysql> desc lms_users;
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| name     | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| password | varchar(23) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
\end{verbatim}

The \verb+books+ database is the table that is used to store the all the books and authors in the table. The books and the author information in this table is concise and allows the user to view or add to this table. The simple description from MySQL is as follows
\begin{verbatim}
mysql> desc books;
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field     | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| isbn      | varchar(20)  | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| book_name | varchar(200) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| author    | varchar(40)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| published | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)

\end{verbatim} 
Further in the testing phase of the program the data is added to the \verb+test_books+ table for convenience in collective data integrity of the main table which is \verb+books+.
\newpage
\begin{verbatim}
mysql> desc test_books;
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field     | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| isbn      | varchar(50)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| book_name | varchar(100) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| author    | varchar(20)  | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| published | int          | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-----------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

\end{verbatim}
\newpage

\subsection{Program Dependency tree}

the tree of the directory structure is given above. The \verb+main.py+ file is the main file that executes the program the user has to run this file in order to get the program running. Other than the main file other custom made library directory called as lms short hand for library management system is used for further working of the program. another file called as \verb+sql_util.py+ and \verb+menu.py+ are the files that provide many functionality to the program to work. The \verb+menu.py+ file is based on the menu and help, the \verb+sql_util.py+ file one of the very important file in the program that allows most of the functions used in the \verb+main.py+ file and for further logging function is also provided. 

Getting out of the \verb+lms+ directory we can see the \verb+data+ directory provides and stores the information regarding the configuration and log data. The \verb+cnx_data.yml+ stores the configuration data for the MySQL user in MySQL like password, user, database etc can be stored in this file, other file called as \verb+logfile+.log is used to store the log data of the program.
The venv is a file for the virtual environment that allows us to include packages in a septate environment away from the base interpreters installed packages that might conflict with the other packages or setting up a different environment for the program.

\part{Post Updates}

\section{Future Updates}
The following program like the rest of the programs are not prefect. The following program can be improved in feature and security.
\begin{itemize} 
\item This program is vulnerable to a SQL injection where a hacker can inject a SQL to alter, delete, view and do all sorts of things with the SQL database. The solution of this problem is that the given program takes a filtered input of the things from the users side.
\item The program can be made online in cloud, rather than running the SQL locally by setting up a server that can act as a universal server where database can be accessed and data can be retrieved 
\item Searching using the regular expression can improve the query result and can make it more useful in searching over the words from the database or files.
\item further advanced commands to link tables in MySQL can improve the overall functionality of the program and can truly bring the concept of foreign key to work.
\item For more security while entering the password the use of \verb+getpass+ module that can remove the echo of the password when typed.
\item For any further development of this program it can be made out of the command line interface to the graphical user interface. The graphical user interface will reach much more audience and will provide a visual appeal to the program including the benefits of the easier user interface and handling
\end{itemize}

\part{Case Study}
\section{Login}
The program is allows only specific people to login or use the LMS. This is done to prevent unauthorized access to the database and prevent any unwanted changes in the database. Further the data can be stored (added) by authorized people only. It asks the user password and name. The user is given 3 chances to present the correct user name and password that is stored inside the database itself. The figure below we can see that the name is a case insensitive but the password is sensitive. Further we are greeted by `Hi' and name in the main screen of the program. \par

\section{Running}
The program is based on waterfall model there after the Circular model encountered in the login screen where the program asks for the verification of the user.

After the program is started and the user is logged in to the program  
the user in prompted with a welcome screen or a home page. The user can then select the usable options in the menu and accordingly do the work.

The program menu offers following features in the listing option
\begin{enumerate}
\item Browse
\item Search
\item Add
\item Explore
\item Exit
\end{enumerate}
other than these options the user can also access the \emph{help} and \emph{version} options respectively. Also a menu option is available that prints the value of the text listed below.

\section{Working}
\subsection{Case 1: Adding the books to the books database}
The data can be added to the books database using the LMS program. By selecting the add option in the main menu a person will get into the add menu of the program. Then the user has to enter his or her credentials to verify that it is him who is adding to the program. After conforming the credentials the person can add the data to the MySQL by answering the questions regarding the new book. The addition command is made on loop so \emph{ a person can add multiple books without getting out of the program}

\subsection{Case 3: Using the Different Searches}
The program allows the user to search in multiple ways in the SQL database. The available options are 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Search using the ISBN
\item Search using the Author name
\item Search using the Title of the Book
\end{enumerate}

Using the find command in the program a person can access the database for search using any of the following above options. The different search options come in handy in case the person is partially aware of the Book.

for any option in the user side any exceptions are either handled using the \verb+try+ and \verb+except+ block and to prevent any input error the use of numeric datatype is limited. The inputs are taken in the string form to minimize the data handling error and is type caste to \verb+int+ or other format using the suitable function.

Further the program is giving messages for exception that occurs while the program is running to prevent crash and to ensure the smooth functioning of the program.

\framebox{}{

}

The basic search also gives an error if not found, when the user enters a author which does not exists then the program tells the user to check for any spelling mistakes and try again.
The add command is a sensitive option that requires a lot of control over the program input from the user in case where the user has entered the wrong thing in the date option the user is prompted with the error message. Also if that field is left blank then also, the user is prompted with the message to prevent the further execution of the program to cause error on the MySQL server side.

\section{Program Module information}
The LMS program consists of many imported modules, most of them found in the local builtin library of python by some can be installed using the Python package index website or pip a common package manager in the command line\footnote{Python Software Foundation recommends using pip for installing the packages}. There are following modules used in the program.

\begin{enumerate}
\item os
\item json
\item secrets
\item string
\item random
\item time
\item mysql-connector-python or mysql-connetor
\item yaml
\end{enumerate}  

\begin{sloppypar}
The modules \verb+os, json, secrets, random+ \& \verb+time+ are builtins and come preinstalled in the python, rest the other 2 modules \verb+yaml+, MySQL connector \verb+mysql-connector-python+\footnote{for updated 8+ version of Mysql} and \verb+mysql-connector+ are installed using pip. For pip to work following conditions should be met --
\end{sloppypar}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{pip must be up-to-date}. The pip does not work when it is lower version and does not install packages in such a condition.
\item \emph{Path configured python installation}. While installing the python programming language using the installer in windows the user must select the add to path checkbox in the installer, if not selected the pip will not be installed to the path and will not work.
\end{itemize}
The following modules \verb+yaml, mysql-connector+ can be installed using the following commands.

\subsection{Usage of Modules}
Modules are used to increase the functionality of the program. They as a helping hand to the programmer by proving him more functions to work with and to make the program feature rich. The modules imported in this Project are of critical importance and they provide much more functionality to the programmer and the end user. The usage of the modules in the Project is mentioned below --

\begin{description}
\item[os] This module is used checking the file's existence and other directory related operations. The functions like \verb+os.getcwd()+ for getting the current working directory of the program when executed, to change the directory the \verb+os.chdir()+ is used to change to the desired directory. Further for checking the existence of the files in the current working directory. A very useful function that lets a user to find out about the operating system type in the computer is \verb+os.name+ for a Linux system it displays `posix' and for the Windows system it shows `nt'. Moreover commands like \verb+os.system()+ allows the programmer to execute commands. Here it is used in \verb+os.system()+ for clearing the screen as both the Linux and Windows uses different types of command for clearing the screen like in Linux we have the clear command as simply \verb+clear+ and for the Windows machine the commonly used command is \verb+cls+. Hence the name function of the os module is very useful. Using the \verb+os.name+\footnote{posix means Linux and nt means Windows} can be used for finding about the operating system of the executing script to cope with the clear commands in both the operating system.
\item[json] JSON\footnote{Java Script Object Notation} is a file format for interchanging data, this module helps us the serialize the list generated by the log function. It is used to dump the list in the file such that it is directly put to the file. In this program functions like \verb+json.dump(list)+ for any list is used for dumping the data in the serialized format. Also it was preferred than another builtin module \verb+pickle+ because the pickle module handles the data in the binary but the log file is meant to be human readable.
\item [secrets] This module is made for securely doing the random bytes or making random choices, this module is just like the \verb+random+ module but more secure. By secure it means that the randomness in this module is preferred over the \verb+random+ module in cases like, random choice maker, random byte generator, etc, it uses the randoms by the operating system according to python documents\footnote{https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html?highlight=secrets}. In this project this module provides functionality to the log generator, to make a random number for uniquely identifying a particular log in the log file.
\item[random] Random module is used for making random number, not as secure as module \verb+secrets+ but helps in generating pseudo random.it can generate pseudo random numbers, integers, making choices etc. Here it is used in function for exploring the Library catalog by randomly selecting the author and book from the Library database accordingly using the list indexing and suitable SQL query.
\item[time] Time is used to get the current time in the program. The function \verb+time.localtime()+ is used to get the current time and is placed inside of the \verb+time.asctime()+ to get the formatted current time used by the log function for printing the timing of the happening of the event.
\item[string] it is a very simple module providing with the strings of data like 123\ldots or abcd\ldots and symbols in both lowercase, uppercase or both cases mixed. This module's \verb+string.digits()+ for list of digits
\item[mysql.connector] This is a module that helps us to make our connection with the MySQL database by giving our credentials like user name, user's password, database to work with etc. Using the cursor we can initiate the query using the \verb+cursor.execute(query)+ command where \verb+cursor+ is a method of the connection. Using this we can execute multiple queries. Further \verb+cursor.fetchall()+ is used to get the result in a variable in the form of nested list of the given query by the programmer.
\item[yaml]  YAML is a data serializing language used for configuration files in a program. In this program a very similar function \verb+yaml.load()+ is used to load the data from the YAML file to the python object. It returns a dictionary and is used for storing credentials for the user to load from. The user can configure the file accordingly to change the password of the database or the username or the database itself and unlike JSON\footnote{JSON is human readable but YAML has better human readability.} it is extremely human readable.  


\end{description}

Further more modules can be used to make it more functionality rich

\section{Logging the Actions}
The program is also made with another feature other than all listed above to make a log of the actions that happen in the program by the user. The format of the log file is custom where it stores different like given below is a real log file from the programs directory 

\framebox{}{
\begin{verbatim}
["Sun Nov  6 19:40:29 2022", "8 2 2 9 1", "Logged in!"]

["Mon Nov  7 17:25:33 2022", "2 3 4 9 7", "searching for a book by its ISBN"]
["Mon Nov  7 17:35:52 2022", "5 6 6 6 7", "Searching on the basis of author "]
["Mon Nov  7 17:56:57 2022", "2 5 4 6 3", "searching for a book by title"]
["Mon Nov  7 17:57:23 2022", "8 6 9 2 2", "displaying the books"]
["Mon Nov  7 17:57:33 2022", "0 2 4 7 6", "searching for a book by title"]
["Mon Nov  7 17:58:52 2022", "8 3 3 5 4", "searching for a book by title"]
["Mon Nov  7 18:46:47 2022", "0 2 4 3 7", "Exiting the program "]
["Mon Nov  7 18:54:56 2022", "6 9 8 5 3", "Login Failed"]
["Mon Nov  7 18:56:58 2022", "9 6 0 9 9", "Logged in!"]
["Mon Nov  7 18:57:15 2022", "8 3 1 4 4", "searching for a book by its ISBN"]
["Mon Nov  7 18:57:25 2022", "4 7 3 3 9", "Searching on the basis of author "]
["Mon Nov  7 18:57:41 2022", "6 5 9 2 6", "Searching on the basis of author "]
\end{verbatim}
}

The above is a log of a real file that can be seen to tell that the user logged in, actions done by the user and further telling the time and a unique id for a particular log is for \emph{finding a particular log in the log file}. Further a unique random number is also made into the log script to make searching of a particular log easy. In the source code of this file the writing is done through \verb+json+ module.
